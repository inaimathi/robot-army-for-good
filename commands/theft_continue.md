# Carry on finding bugs!

Can you find any more bugs in `$ARGUMENTS` using the same rubric? Continue in the same manner and produce a bug report if appropriate.

If you believe there's really nothing left to test in `$ARGUMENTS` then create a file in the project root called `FINISHED`. This will conclude testing for `$ARGUMENTS`.
